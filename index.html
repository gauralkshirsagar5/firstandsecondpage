    <h4>DESCRIPTION</h4>
    There's one simple reason we call this our everyday oxford; we wear them pretty much every single day.
    <br>
    <br>
    


<h4>MATERIAL</h4>
Just the right amount for year round wear.Soft to the touch but built for a decade of solid wear.Oxford is a perfectly versatile fabric that looks just as good present as it does pulled off the back of a chair.While traditional cotten uses 25 percent of the world's pesticides,our organic cotten doesn't use a drop. A better shirt,responsible built for the long haul.
